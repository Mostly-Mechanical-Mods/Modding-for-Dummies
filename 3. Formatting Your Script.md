# Formatting your script

Mostly Mechanical Mods presents Modding for Dummies. In this episode, we will be talking about how to properly format your script.

## Editing script files

Script files are text files, which you can edit with any text editor, though I would strongly recommend avoiding the base Notepad, used by default in Windows when opening text files, which looks like crap, and encourage you to download a decent text editor like Visual Studio Code, which has neafty features which I will cover in a separate video.

Small disclaimer: you’ll see me using
`
<text enclosed in smaller than and greater than signs>
`
: this is not script syntax, it’s a placeholder commonly used to indicate that *something* should go there.

## Brackets and Indentation

As we saw briefly in the tutorial covering Convetions of Script Files, script is written in blocks, and a block is defined by an opening bracket preceded by an equal sign, and a corresponding closing bracket. Corresponding is key here: you should always have exactly the same number of opening and closing brackets in your files. If you don’t, something is wrong.

```
To spot bracketing errors more easily, whenever you open a block = {
  indent the next line, using the tab key,
  and always unindent before closing a block, using shift + tab
}
```

In Visual Studio Code, you can indent and unindent whole blocks at a time by selecting them before using tab key.

```
Script blocks can be nested inside one another = {
  Every time you open a new block = {
    you should indent the next line
    and unindent again when you close each block
  }
  so it is always clear what block a line of script belongs to
}
```

These are formatting conventions. They are not strictly necessary, and you could very well write a lot of things in line, and 
```
open = { and = { close = { multiple blocks } in a single line }}
```
but I strongly advise against it, especially if you’re a beginner. It is sometimes tempting to make your script as condensed as possible, because sometimes it looks better, and to be fair, I often do in my own mods, but you’re much better off having script that you can easily understand, and in which errors are easier to spot, than script that looks neat on your screen.

This is especially true when asking someone to review your code to help you fix a problem, either on the forums, or on Discord, where both the official CK3 Discord (run by Paradox) and the CK3 Mod Co-op Discord (run by the community), have support channels. If your script isn’t formatted correctly, you’re much less likely that someone will look into it, and that they spot a mistake if they do review it.

## Commenting

In script, the hashtag sign is used to effectively exclude anything that follows from the script, by which I mean

`# the game won’t read this`.

It is useful for two things:

-	Commenting your script, leaving yourself (or others) notes about what a script block is doing. Vanilla files are full of those, and it is useful to comment your script as you make progress, because 3 months from now, when a patch requires you to modify things in your mod, you might not remember exactly what every single piece of script intended to achieve

-	Disabling script. If part of your script is incomplete, you might want to disable it so it doesn’t provoke bugs. Or if you have bugs and errors that you can’t explain, commenting out parts of your script until the game works properly can help you hone in on the specific part of the script that is causing problems.

Oh and when you’re ready to publish your mod? Do leave your comments in, that’s what they’re here for, but if you commented out broken script, please don’t leave it in, it’s just messy. I often forget to myself, but hey, do as I say, not as I do!

## Key Takeaway

The thing to remember here is: keep your script orderly. It will make it easier to spot mistakes, easier for others to assist you if you need help, and easier for the maintenance of your mod in the long run, when a game patch breaks it and you need to review and patch your mod long after you’ve forgotten how it worked.

That’s it for this tutorial! This was Mostly Mechanical Mods’ Modding for Dummies, thank you for watching, and I will see you in the next video.
