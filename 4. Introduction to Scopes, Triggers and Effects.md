# Introduction to Scopes, Triggers and Effects

Mostly Mechanical Mods presents Modding for Dummies. In this video, we'll be explaining the base concepts of Scopes, Triggers and Effects.

A Scope is a game object that has 3 fundamental characteristics:
- You can read information from it
- You can write information on it
- You can move from one object to another

## Scope types, keys, and where to find them

"Game object" is a bit of an abstract definition, and of course we're not talking about stools and spoons here. There is a definite number of Scope types in the game: Character, House, Dynasty, Title, Province, Religion, Faith, Culture, War, CB, Army – those are all scope types. The complete list is on the CK3 modding wiki, which I will link in the description.

For each of these Scope types, you will find a folder in the game files, usually in the common/ folder. So if we're looking for the Christianity religion, we'll head to common/religion, where we'll find all religion in the base game - and where you can add your own. There are two exceptions to this, Character and Title Scopes, which are defined in the history/ folder, because what characters and titles exist on game start depends on the start date you're using.

In those files, each top level script block is the definition of a specific scope, and the key of that top level block is the key of that specific scope, which is useful for referencing it in script. You can access any scope object in script by typing its type and its key separated by a column, and opening a script block: `religion:christianity_religion = {}` accesses the Christianity religion, and anything written in that block will be understood in the context of that specific scope.

Characters are a bit tricky because they have 2 keys, called IDs, which are shown when you are in debug_mode in the AI Values tooltip. The first ID is what we call a runtime ID: it is set while the game is running, and you can never know what runtime ID a character will have in advance, so you cannot reference it in script. 

The 2nd ID is the historical ID: this is the ID of preset characters that are generated on game start, it is unique to each starting or historical character, and will be the same every time you start the game, so this historical ID is the one you need to use to access a specific character. From then on, we will use the ID of Charles the Bald, which we can reference in script by using `character:90104 = {}`

## Triggers

As I've said, a Scope is a game object you can read information from: that's what Triggers do. Triggers are commands that check whether an object fulfills certain conditions, and they return what we call a boolean: either true or false.

So for Charles the Bold, for example, we can check whether that character is a player, by using the trigger `is_ai = no` in the context of Charles the Bold's scope:
```
character:90104 = {
    is_ai = no
}
```
If that character is a player, `is_ai = no` is true. If that character is an AI, `is_ai = no` is false.

## Effects

A Scope is also a game object you can write information on: that's what Effects do. Effects are commands that actually change the gamestate.

Staying with Charles, we can give him 100 gold, using the effect `add_gold` in the proper context:
```
character:90104 = {
    add_gold = 100
}
```

## Key Takeaways

There will be more specific videos on each of the three concepts, but for the moment, the important thing to remember is:
a Scope is the context in which Triggers are checked, and Effects are executed. So when you're using Triggers and Effects, always be mindful of what scope you are in.
