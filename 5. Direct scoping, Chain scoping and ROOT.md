# Direct scoping, Chain scoping, and ROOT

Mostly Mechanical Mods presents Modding for Dummies. In this video, we'll be talking about the 3 relative ways to access Scopes.

## Scoping

To use Effects or Triggers in the context of a Scope, you need to access that scope in script: this is what we call "scoping".

As we've seen in the Introduction to Scopes, If you want to access a specific object, you just need to know its scope type and its key, and use them to open a script block.
```
character:90104 = {
    # you scoped to Charles the Bold
}
```

But for characters, you can only use their historical ID to access them, so how can you access a character scope that is not defined in the history files?

## Direct Scoping

The 2nd way to access a scope is direct scoping.

Remember that one of the characteristics of scopes is that you can move from one object to another? That’s what direct scoping is.

From any Character, you can move to their `father` if they have one, their `real_father` which, in true CK fashion, might no be the same character as the father, their `mother`, their `primary_spouse`, their `liege` if the character is a vassal, their `primary_heir` once they’ve been born. So you can move freely from one Character to another that has a unique relation to them, and unique is the key word here: there is no direct scope to a character's child, because any character can have several children, so the game wouldn't know which child you intend to access.

From a Character scope, you can also move to their `faith`, their `culture`, their `primary_title`, their `house`, their `dynasty` – and it goes on. From a Dynasty scope, you can move to the `dynasty_head`; from the a Faith scope, you can move to its `head_of_faith` if its doctrines allow for one. All available direct scopes for any one scope type are listed in the wiki, so check it out for reference.

When using direct scoping, you don’t need to use a scope type as a prefix: just use the direct scope, and open a block. The game already knows that `father` scopes to a Character scope type, and that `dynasty` scopes to a Dynasty scope type.

And of course, you can nest those. From Charles the Bald, you can access his father King Louis I, and from there you can access his father, Karloman.
```
character:90104 = {     # scopes to Charles the Bald
    father = {          # scopes to Charles the Bald's father
        father = {      # scopes to Charles the Bald's father's father
                        # the context of this script block is Karloman
        }
    }
}
```

But what if you want to access the `culture` of the `head_of_faith` of the `faith` of Karloman’s wife Hildegard?

## Chain scoping

That’s where the 3rd way to access scopes comes in: chain scoping.

Of course, you can nest scopes indefinitely, but it can get real messy real fast. Chain scoping is basically a shorthand : instead of opening a block each step of the way, you can simply chain direct scopes by separating them with a single dot. So if you want to access the culture of the head_of_faith of the faith of Karloman’s wife, who is the mother of the father of Charles the bald, you can, without opening a new block each step of the way
```
character:90104.father.mother.faith.head_of_faith.culture = {
    # Hildegard was Catholic, so on game start in year 867, this scopes to the culture of Pope Nicolaus, who is Italian
}
```

## ROOT

Until now, we've been starting our scope chains from a specific scope, that of good old Charles. But most of the time, you won't be doing that: you will be working from a top scope that the game provides you, and which you can call back upon anytime using ROOT. The capitalization isn't required, but I like to use it, so it stands out in my script.

What ROOT is depends on what kind of file you're setting up. In Decisions, ROOT is the character taking the decision. In Events, ROOT is the character that received the event.

So whenever the game provides you with a ROOT scope, by default, anything you script is understood in the context of that scope: you usually don't need to scope to ROOT yourself: the context is already set, and from there, you can use Direct Scoping, or Chain Scoping. Paradox documents what scope ROOT is pretty well, so if you pay attention to the comments in script, you shouldn’t have any nasty surprise.

## Key Takeaways

The key takeaway here is, scoping is most often done relatively to a ROOT scope provided by the game, using Direct Scoping or Chain Scoping - and now you know how to do that!
