# Effects

Mostly Mechanical Mods presents Modding for Dummies. In this video, we'll be talking more about Effects.

## List of effects

As we've seen in the "Introduction to Scopes, Triggers and Effects" tutorial, Effects are commands that modify the game state. There are a lot of different effects, and the first thing you should do is get the proper documentation for them. There is a page on the wiki, but it can be outdated, and does not have all necessary information, so instead, I would urge you to get into the game in debug_mode, and in the console command, type `script_docs`. This will generate some .log files in the game's /log/ folder. And in this file, you will find the list of all effects, and what they do.

In script, effects, like most things, following a simple `a = b` structure, where `a` is the effect's key (which you will find in that effect.log), and `b` is a parameter. More on those in a minute.

## Effects blocks

Effects need to be used in what we call Effects block, so that the game can actually recognize those effects for what they are. They are introduced in a variety of ways, we'll just go over the most common ones.

In Decisions, you will find an `effect = { }` block: anything in that block will be understood by the game as being effects, in the context of the scope of the character that took the decision. Rather straightforward.

In Events, you will find several effect blocks with different names, that all consider the character that received the event as ROOT, or the top level scope:
- `immediate = { }` is an effect block that is executed when an event is fired
- `option = { }` is an effect block that is executed when the character that received the event clicks on an event option, and an event can have several such option blocks.  
All commands in an option block are not effects, for example those blocks also use a `name = < localization string >` parameter, but any effect can be used in that option block.
- `after = { }` is an effect block that is executed after the character chose an option, and whatever option they chose

There are other types of effect block out there, depending on what you're working on, and you'll learn what those are in due time.

## Supported Scopes

Remember how we said that a Scope is the context in which Effects are executed?
In the effects.log, for each effect, you will see the mention `Supported Scopes:`, which tells you in which scope type you can use that effect.

For example, `add_gold` supports Character scopes, and will only work in the context of a Character scope. Using it in a culture scope will not do anything, as giving gold to a culture makes no sense. So when an effect is not working, check that you are using it in a supported scope type.

If you're in a decision's `immediate = {}` block, since the top level scope in that effect block is the character that receives the event:
```
immediate = {
    < effect >                                  # executes the effects on the character that received the event
}
```

If instead, you want to give 100 gold to that character's father, then you will have to scope to that character before using the effect:
```
immediate = {
    father = {
        < effect >                              # executes the effect on the father of the character that received the event
    }
}
```

And if the top level scope is a Character scope, but you want to use an effect that supports a Title scope, like `clear_title_laws`:
```
immediate = {
    primary_title = {
        < effect >                              # executes the effect on the primary title of the character that received the event
    }
}
```

## Effects parameters

In the base `a = b` syntax, `a` is the effect key, and `b` is a parameter.

For the `add_gold` effect, the documentation doesn't really tell you what kind of parameter it expects, but what the effect does gives you a pretty good hint that b should be a numerical value:  
```
immediate = {
    add_gold = 100                              # add 100 gold to the currently scoped character
}
```

When the parameter type is not necessarily obvious, the documentation will usually tells you what it's expecting.
For the `add_dynasty_perk` effect, for example, the documentation says it is expecting a key, and we've already seen how to look for those. Head to the common/dynasty_perks folder, and in those files, you will find all dynasty perks that exist in the base game, and their keys, which you can use as parameters of that effect:
```
immediate = {
    dynasty = {                                 # scopes to the dynasty of the character that received the event
        add_dynasty_perk = blood_legacy_1       # adds the 1st perk of the Blood dynasty legacies to that dynasty
    }
}
```

## Supported Targets

Some effects have a `Supported Targets` mention. This means that in your `a = b` syntax, `b` should be a scope, and Supported Targets tell you what scope type it is expecting.
`set_father`, for example, has the mention `Supported Targets: character`
so when using this effect, you should write `set_father = < character scope >`

Here you can use any of the scoping methods we've covered already:

```
immediate = {
    set_father = character:90104                # sets Charles the Bold as the father of the character that received the event
}
```

```
immediate = {
    set_father = mother.father                  # sets the grandfather on the mother side of the character that received the event as their own father (yup, that's incest right there)
}
```

## Multiple parameters

Some effects can have several parameters, and in the `a = b` syntax, b can be a script block, so the syntax would look something like this: `a = { b = c }`

The `death` effect, for example, can have 2 parameters: `killer`, which expects a character scope, and `death_reason`, which expects a death_reason key, and those need to go in a block.
As for dynasty_perks, the various death_reason keys can be found in the appropriately named common/deathreasons/ folder
```
immediate = {
    death = {                                   # the character that received the event is killed...
        killer = father                         # ... by their father...
        death_reason = death_fight              # ... in a fight
    }
}
```

## Multiple syntaxes

Some effects can allow for several different syntaxes. After all, not every character is murdered in CK3, so the same `death` effect could be used with a single parameter, `natural`, which the game understands as the character dying of a random natural causes.
```
immediate = {
    death = natural                             # let the game pick a random natural cause for this character's death
}
```

## Key Takeaways

The three things to remember here is:
- get the proper documentation, the effect.log, that will tell you everything you need to know about any of the game's effects - and there are hundreds of them
- always make sure you are using effects in appropriate effect blocks
- always make sure you are using effects in the context of a scope type that they support
